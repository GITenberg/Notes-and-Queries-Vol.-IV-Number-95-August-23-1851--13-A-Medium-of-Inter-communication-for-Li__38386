<h3><span>THE PENDULUM DEMONSTRATION OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION.</span></h3>

<p>If the propounders of this theory had from the first explained that they
do not claim, for <i>the plane of oscillation</i>, an exemption from the
general rotation of the earth, but only the difference of rotation due
to the excess of velocity with which one extremity of the line of
oscillation may be affected more than the other, it would have saved a
world of fruitless conjecture and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>For myself I can say that it is only recently I have become satisfied
that this is the real extent of the claim; and I confess that had I been
aware of it sooner, I should have regarded the theory with greater
respect than I have hitherto been disposed to do. Perhaps this avowal
may render more acceptable the present note, in which I shall endeavour
to make plain to others that which so long remained obscure to myself.</p>

<p>It is well known that the more we advance from the poles of the earth
towards the equator, so much greater becomes the velocity with which the
surface of the earth revolves&mdash;just as any spot near the circumference
of a revolving wheel travels farther in a given time, and consequently
swifter, than a spot near the centre of the same wheel: hence, London
being nearer to the equator than Edinburgh, the former must rotate with
greater velocity than the latter. Now if we imagine a pendulum suspended
from such an altitude, and in such a position, that one extremity of its
line of oscillation shall be supposed to reach to London and the other
to Edinburgh; and if we imagine the ball of such pendulum to be drawn
towards, and retained over London, it is clear that, so long as it
remains in that situation, it will share the velocity of London, and
rotate with it. But if it be set at liberty it will immediately begin to
oscillate between London and Edinburgh, retaining, <i>it is asserted</i>, the
velocity of the former place. Therefore during its first excursion
towards Edinburgh, it will be impressed with a velocity greater than
that of the several points of the earth over which it has to traverse;
so that when it arrives at Edinburgh it will be in advance of the
rotation of that place; and consequently its actual line of oscillation,
instead of falling directly upon Edinburgh, will diverge, and fall
somewhere to the east of it.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that if the pendulum ball be supposed to retain the same
velocity of rotation, <i>undiminished</i>, which was originally impressed
upon it at London, it must, in its return from Edinburgh, retrace the
effects just described, and again return to coincidence with London,
having all the time retained a velocity equal to that of London. If this
were truly the case, the deviation in one
<a id="one130"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[130]</span>
 direction would be
restored in the opposite one, so that the only result would be a
repetition of the same effects in every succeeding oscillation.</p>

<p>It is this absence of an element of increase in the deviation that
constitutes the first objection to this theory as a sufficient
explanation of the pendulum phenomenon. It is answered (as I suppose,
for I have nowhere seen it so stated in direct terms) that the velocity
of rotation, acquired and retained by the pendulum ball, is <i>not</i> that
of London, but of a point midway between the two extremes&mdash;in fact, of
that point of the earth's surface immediately beneath the centre of
suspension.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, if this can be established, the line of
oscillation would diverge in both directions&mdash;the point of return, or of
restored coincidence, which before was in one of the extremes, would
then be in the central point; consequently it would be of no effect in
correcting the deviation, which would then go on increasing with every
oscillation.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to obtain credence for the theory, satisfactory
explanation must be given of this first difficulty by not only showing
that the medium velocity <i>is really that</i> into which the extreme
velocity first impressed upon the ball will ultimately be resolved; but
it must also be explained <i>when</i> that effect will take place, whether
all at once or gradually; because, it must be recollected, the
oscillations of the experimental pendulum cannot practically commence
from the central point, but always from one of the extremes, to which
the ball must first be elevated.</p>

<p>But this is not enough: there must also be shown reasonable ground to
induce the belief that the ball is <i>really free</i> from the attraction of
each successive point of the earth's surface over which it passes; and
that, although in motion, it is <i>not</i> as really and as effectually a
partaker in the rotation of any given point, during its momentary
passage over it, as though it were fixed and stationary at that point.
Those who maintain that this is not the case are bound to state the
<i>duration of residence</i> which any substance must make at any point upon
the earth's surface, in order to oblige it to conform to the exact
amount of velocity with which that point revolves.</p>

<p>Lastly, supposing theses difficulties capable of removal, there yet
remains a third, which consists in the undeniable absence of <i>difference
of velocity</i> when the direction of oscillation is east and west. It has
been shown that the difference before claimed was due to the nearer
approach to the equator of one of the extremities of the line of
oscillation in consequence of its direction being north and south; but
when its direction is east and west both extremities are equally distant
from the equator, and therefore no difference of velocity can exist.</p>

<p>I have directed these observations to the fundamental truth and reality
of the alleged phenomenon; it is quite clear that these must first be
settled before the laws of its distribution on the surface of the globe
can become of any interest.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>The Day of the Month.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Many persons might help themselves, as some do,
by remembering throughout the year on what day the 1st of January fell,
and by permanently remembering the first day of each month, which agrees
with the first day of the year. Thus, this present year began on
Wednesday, and the 6th of August is therefore Wednesday, as are the
13th, 20th, 27th. By the following lines the key to the months may be
kept in mind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> The first day of October, you'll find if you try,</p>
      <p>The second of April, as well as July,</p>
     <p> The third of September, which rhymes to December,}</p>
      <p>The fourth day of June, and no other, remember,}</p>
     <p> The fifth of the leap-month, of March, and November,}</p>
     <p> The sixth day of August, and seventh of May,</p>
      <p>Show the <i>first</i> of the year in the name of the day;</p>
     <p> But in leap-year, when leap-month has duly been reckoned,</p>
     <p> These month-dates will show, not the <i>first</i>, but the <i>second</i>.</p>
</div>

 <p class="right">   M.</p>




<h4><span><i>Foreign English.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The specimens given in "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" have
reminded me of one which seems worthy to accompany them; in fact, to
have rather a peculiar claim.</p>

<p>I believe the facts of the case to have been these. When it was known
that Louis XVIII. was to be restored to the throne of France, a report
was circulated (whether on any good authority I do not know) that the
then Duke of Clarence would take the command of the vessel which was to
convey the returning monarch to Calais. At all events the people of
Calais expected it; and inferring that the English royal duke would pass
at least one night in their town, and of course go to the play, they
deemed that it would be proper to perform the English national anthem at
their theatre. It was obvious, however, that "God save the <i>King</i>" was
so very appropriate to their own circumstances, that, notwithstanding
its Anglicism, it left less of compliment and congratulation for the
illustrious foreigner than they really intended to offer. So that happy
people, who can do everything in no time, forthwith prepared an
additional verse. This being quite new, and of course unknown, they
printed on the playbill, from which I learned it. If you give his lines
a place in your pages, I will not say that the French poet's labour was
thrown away; but for
<a id="for131"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[131]</span>
 the time it was so, as the English duke
did not accompany the French king. I believe that the additional verse
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "God save noble Clarénce</p>
      <p>Who brings our king to France,</p>
               <p class="i5"> God save Clarénce;</p>
      <p>He maintains the glorý</p>
      <p>Of the British navý,</p>
     <p> Oh! God, make him happý,</p>
                <p class="i5">God save Clarénce."</p>
</div>

<p>I am sorry that I can only speak from memory of the contents of a
document which I have not seen for so many years; but if I may have made
any mistake, perhaps some reader may be able to correct me.</p>

 <p class="right">   S. R. M.</p>



<h4><span><i>Birds' Care for the Dead.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;It is not uncommon to find in poets of all
ages some allusion to the pious care of particular birds for the bodies
of the dead. Is there any truth in the idea? for certainly the old
ballad of "The Children in the Wood" has made many a kind friend for the
Robin Redbreast by the affecting lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "No burial this pretty pair</p>
       <p class="i3"> Of any man receives,</p>
      <p>Till Robin Redbreast piously</p>
        <p class="i3">Did cover them with leaves."</p>
</div>

<p>Herrick also alludes to the same tradition in his verses "upon Mrs.
Elizabeth Wheeler, under the name of Amarillis." (<i>Works</i>, vol i. pp.
62-3.: Edin. 1823)</p>

<div class="poem">
        <p class="i3">"Sweet Amarillis, by a spring's</p>
      <p class="i3">Soft and soule-melting murmurings,</p>
        <p class="i3">Slept; and thus sleeping, thither flew,</p>
      <p class="i3">A Robin Redbreast; who at view,</p>
    <p class="i3">Not seeing her at all to stir,</p>
    <p class="i3">Brought leaves and moss to cover her;</p>
     <p class="i3">But while he, perking, there did prie</p>
     <p class="i3">About the arch of either eye,</p>
    <p class="i3">The lid began to let out day,</p>
   <p class="i3">At which poor Robin flew away;</p>
      <p>And seeing her not dead, but all disleav'd,</p>
      <p>He chirpt for joy, to see himself disceav'd."</p>
</div>

<p>In the earlier editions of Gray's <i>Elegy</i>, before the Epitaph, the
following exquisite lines were inserted:</p>

<h4><span><i>Snake's Antipathy to Fire.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;There is in Brazil a very common poisonous
snake, the Surucucu (<i>Trigonocephalus rhombeatus</i>), respecting which the
Matutos and Sertanejos, the inhabitants of the interior, relate the
following facts. They say that such is the antipathy of this reptile to
fire, that when fires are made in the clearing away of woods, they rush
into it, scattering it with their tails till it is extinguished, even
becoming half roasted in the attempt; and that when an individual is
passing at night with a torch, they pass and repass him, lashing him
with their tales till he drop it, and the snake is immediately found
closely coiled round the extinguished torch. The greatest enemy of this
snake is an immense Lacertian, five and six feet long, the Tiju-açu (the
great lizard&mdash;its name in the Lingoa geral): it is said that when the
snake succeeds in effecting a bite, the lizard rushes into the wood,
eats some herb, and returns to the conflict, which almost invariable
terminates in its favour.</p>

for him;&mdash;and that Absalom's long hair, of which he was so proud, and
which as consequently so often served "to point a moral and adorn a

hair upon it, having been caught in the boughs of the tree?</p>

<h3><span>THE LADY ELIZABETH HORNER OR MONTGOMERY.</span></h3>

<p>In some curious manuscript memoirs of the family of Horner of Mells, co.
Somerset, written probably about the middle of the last century, I find
the following statement:&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "The gentleman at Mells last mentioned, whose name I don't know,
   had his <i>eldest son George</i>, who succeeded him at Mells. He
   married the Countess of Montgomery, supposed to be the widow of
   that earl, who, in tilting with Henry II., King of France
   caused
<a id="caused132"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[132]</span>
his death by a splinter of his spear running into
   the king's eye. But most probably she was the widow of that
   lord's son, which I conjecture from the distance of the time of
   that king's death to her death, which must needs be near seventy
   years, as she lived at Cloford to the year 1628. She must
   certainly be a considerable heiress, as several estates came with
   her into the family, and, among others, Postlebury-woods in
   particular, and, possibly, also the Puddimore estate; as her son,
   Sir John Horner, was the first of the family that presented a
   clerk to that living in 1639, viz., William Kemp, who was
   afterwards one of the suffering clergy. Her jointure was a
   500<i>l.</i> a-year, which was very considerable at that time."</p>


<p>Can any of your readers assist in elucidating this story, of which no
existing family records afford any corroboration, and which the
parochial registers of the neighbourhood appear rather to invalidate in
some of its statements? As far as we can gather from such sources, the
gentleman alluded to in the extract was not <i>George</i> but <i>Thomas</i>
Horner, born 1547, M.P. for Somersetshire 1585, and sheriff 1607, who
was buried 1612. He married three times: <i>first</i>, Elizabeth Pollard, who
died, as well as her only son John in 1573; <i>secondly</i>, Jane Popham, who
died 1591, having had, amongst other issues, <i>Sir John</i>, born about
1580; and <i>thirdly</i>, as it would seem, a person called "The Lady
Elizabeth," who had issue <i>Edward</i>, born 1597, and who was buried at
<i>Cloford</i>, in 1599. Even allowing for the errors attendant upon a
tradition, it is scarcely <i>possible</i> that this "Lady Elizabeth" should
have been widow of Count Gabriel de Montgomery,&mdash;<i>Elizabeth de la
Zouch</i>,&mdash;who married her first husband in 1549, and was left a widow in
1574. She <i>might</i> have been widow of one of his sons; though the only
two mentioned in the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, Gabriel and Jacques, left
issue, to whom their wives' property would have probably descended.</p>

<p>The whole matter, as far as I have been able to examine it, is a very
obscure one, and yet can hardly, I should think, be without some
foundation in fact. The title-deeds of Postlebury and Puddimore perhaps
would throw light upon it.</p>

<h3><span>POPE AND FLATMAN.</span></h3>

<p>I possess a small volume entitled <i>Manchester al Mondo; Contemplations
of Death and Immortality</i>, by the Earl of Manchester: the 15th edit.,
1688. At the end are appended several short but quaint poems on the
subject of mortality. One of them is stated to be taken from the
"incomparable Poems by the ingenious Mr. Thomas Flatman," and is
entitled "A Thought of Death." I have transcribed it side by side with
Pope's celebrated ode, "The Dying Christian to his Soul," in which some
lines run remarkably parallel. Is it probable Pope borrowed his idea of
the fine couplet,</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   "Hark! they whisper; angels say,</p>
    <p>  Sister Spirit, come away!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">from Flatman? If not, the coincidence is remarkable: has it been noticed
before? Perhaps some of your readers may be better able to enter into
the subject than he who communicates this.</p>

      <p>Nor dust the <i>rites of spousal grace</i></p>
      <p>So much she feared each holy place," &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, Sec. VI.:</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   "<i>The spousal rites</i> were ended soon."</p>
</div>

<p>And again, in Sect. VIII. are these words:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "To quit them, on the English side,</p>
     <p> Red Roland Forster loudly cried,</p>
      <p>'A deep carouse to yon fair <i>bride</i>!'"</p>
</div>

<p>Now, in the ordinary acceptation of these words the <i>spousal rite</i> means
nuptials, and a <i>bride</i> means a newly married wife; and as the ceremony
of the <i>spousal rite</i> is described as taking place with much pomp in the
chapel, and at the altar, it looks very like a wedding indeed. But if,
after all, it were only a betrothal, I willingly withdraw the charge of
"<i>incuria</i>," and subscribe to the propriety of the

<p>And now a word touching M.'s hint of giving a corner in the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span>
Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" to the "Prophecy of Criticism." If he will forgive me the
remark, I do not think the phrase a very happy one. Criticism does not
<i>prophecy</i>, it <i>pronounces</i>, and is valuable only in proportion to the
judgment, taste, and knowledge displayed in its sentence. Above all, the
critic should be impartial, and by no means allow himself to be biassed
by either prejudice or prepossession, whether personal or political.
Still less should he sacrifice his subject in order to prove the
acuteness and point of his own weapon, which is too often dipped in gall
instead of honey. To what extent these qualifications are found in our
modern reviewers let each man answer according to his own experience:
but as critics are not infallible, and as authors generally see more,
feel more, and think more than the ordinary run of critics and readers
give them credit for, I doubt not that a place will always be open in
the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," in answer to the <i>fallacies</i> of criticism,
wherever they may be detected.</p>

<h3><span>MEANING OF "PRENZIE."<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 63, 64.)</span></h3>

<p>As your correspondent A. E. B. has endeavoured to strengthen the case in
favour of the word <i>precise</i> being the proper reading of "prenzie," will
you allow me to suggest a few further points for consideration in
inquiring into the meaning of this word?</p>

<p>I am afraid your etymological readers are in danger of being misled by
the plausible theory that "prenzie" is not an error of the press or
copyist, but a true word. In reference to this view of the case, as
taken by your several correspondents, allow me to suggest, first: that
Shakspeare was no word-coiner; secondly, that, for application in a
passage of such gravity, he would not have been guilty of the
affectation of using a newly-imported Scotch word; and, thirdly, that,
as we may reasonably infer that he was essentially popular in the choice
of words, so he used such as were intelligible to his audience. A word
of force and weight sufficient to justify its use twice in the passage
in question, if merely popular, would surely not so entirely have gone
out of use; whereas if merely literary it would still be to be found in
books.</p>

<p>My greatest objection to the word <i>precise</i> is its inharmoniousness in
the <i>position</i> it holds in the verse; and this objection would not be
removed by adopting <i>Mr. Singer's</i> suggestion of accentuating the first
syllable, which must then be short, and the word pronounced <i>pressis</i>?
How horrible! Besides, if that were the case, as Shakspeare does not
vary in his accent, the corroboratory passage on which the advocates of
<i>precise</i> depend would read, then, thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
                            <p class="i11">"Lord Angelo is <i>pressis</i>,</p>
   <p>   Stands at a guard with envy, scarce <i>confesses</i>," &amp;c.;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the double ending rhyme giving it the air of burlesque. The
appropriateness of <i>precise</i>, moreover, depends chiefly upon its being
assumed to express the quality of a <i>precision</i>, which has not only not
been proved, but which I am inclined very much to doubt.</p>

<p>Has it not been a true instinct that has guided the early English
commentators to the choice of words of the form of "prince<i>ly</i>,"
"priest<i>ly</i>," and myself to "saint<i>ly</i>," and do not the two passages
taken together require this form in reference to a character such as
that of a <i>prince</i>, a <i>priest</i>, or a <i>saint</i>? For instance, the term
<i>pious</i> might be applied to Angelo, equally well with <i>priestly</i> or
<i>saintly</i>; but it could not correctly be applied to garb or vestments,
while either of the latter could.</p>

<p>In what respect is the "cunning" of the "livery of hell" shown, if "the
damnedst body" be not invested in "guards" of the most opposite
character? Shakspeare never exactly repeats himself, though we
frequently find the same idea varied in form and differently applied.
The following passage from <i>Othello</i>, Act II. Sc. 3., appears to be
intended to convey the same idea as the one in question, and thus
strengthens the opinion that, if not <i>saintly</i>, one of like form and
meaning was intended:</p>

<div class="poem">
                              <p class="i11">"Divinity of hell!</p>
      <p>When devils will their blackest sins put on,</p>
     <p> They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</p>
     <p> As I do now."</p></div>

<p>Any of your readers who are acquainted with the common careless
handwriting in use at the time, will greatly oblige by informing me if
it be beyond likelihood that a word commencing with the letter <i>s</i>
should have been read as though it began with <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>I have no intention of continuing the contest on the meaning of
"eisell," nor should I have felt it necessary to notice the remarks of
J. S. W. in No. 91., had they been avowedly in opposition to mine and
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER'S</span>. But when the advocate assumes the ermine, and proceeds to
sum up the evidence and pass judgment, I feel it only right that those
points in which he has <i>misrepresented</i> my argument should not be passed
over. I did <i>not</i> say "that the word cannot mean a river because the
definite article is omitted before it." What I did say was, that
"English idiom requires an article <i>unless it be personified</i>." Milton's
lines merely confirm this, though I am willing to admit
<a id="admit136"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[136]</span>
that
the argument is of little weight When, however, J. S. W. expresses his
surprise that "a gentleman who exhorts," &amp;c., had not looked to the
<i>general drift</i> of the passage, I fancy he cannot have read my first
observations with regard to it, in which I say "the <i>idea</i> of the
passage appears to be," &amp;c. What is this but the "general drift?" Before
finally leaving this subject, allow me to explain, that, in objecting to
the terms "mere verbiage" and "extravagant rant" of a correspondent, I
took them <i>together</i>. I included the latter perhaps hastily. But,
however "extravagant" the "rant" of his real or assumed madmen may be, I
am satisfied that there is <i>no</i> "mere verbiage" to be found in
Shakspeare.</p>

<p>   The copy here described contains the "folding plate" mentioned by
   your correspondent; and as it was a presentation copy from the
   Earl of Egmont to Earl Ferrers, the presumption is that it is an

<p>In answer to the Query of your correspondent H.T.E., I beg to state that
the folding map of part of the estate of John Perceval, Earl of Egmont,
does occur in my copy of <i>The House of Yvery</i>, at page 92. of the
<i>first</i> volume. Lowndes, in his list of the plates, assigns this map to
the second volume; but its proper place is as above. Perhaps this
mistake of Lowndes may have given rise to the doubt as to the existence
of this map; but I suppose any copy of the work without it must be
considered imperfect.</p>

<h3><span>QUEEN BRUNÉHAUT.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 86)</span></h3>

<p>I am sure that you will not be sorry to hear that "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" is
a great favourite with young people; and I hope you will have no
objection to encourage our "pursuits of literature" by admitting into
your delightful miscellany this little contribution.</p>

<p>I have been reading Thierry's <i>History of the Norman Conquest</i> these
holidays; and when I saw M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">REEN'S</span> Queries respecting St. Gregory and
Queen Brunéhaut, I remembered that the historian had mentioned them. On
referring to the passage, at p. 11. of the translation published by
Whittaker and Co., 1843, I found that (1.) "Le Saint Pape Grégoire," who
"donna des éloges de gloire" to Queen Brunéhaut, <i>was</i> Gregory the
Great;&mdash;that (2.) This illustrious Pope <i>did</i> actually degrade himself
by flattering the bad queen;&mdash;and (3.) That the proof of his having done
so is to be found in a passage of one of Gregory's letters given by
Thierry, and appearing in the foot-note "12" at p. 11. of Messrs.
Whittaker's edition, as follows:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Excellentia ergo vestræ quæ proba in bonis consuevit esse
   operibus."&mdash;"In omnipotentis Dei timore, excelleltiæ vestræ mens
   soliditate firmata."&mdash;<i>Epist. Greg. Papæ, apud Script. rer.
   Gallic. et Francic.</i>, tom. iv. p. 21.</p>


  <p class="right">E<span class="smcap lowercase">DITH</span> C.</p>

<p class="left">Preston, Aug. 1851.</p>

<p>It is, I think, indisputable that the St. Gregory commemorated on the
tomb of Brunéhaut is <i>Pope Gregory the Great</i>. Among his <i>Letters</i> are
several addressed to the Frankish queen, betokening the unqualified
esteem in which she was held by the Roman pontiff. See <i>Gregor. Opp.</i>
(tom. ii., edit.

vii. Indict. i. ep. 5.; Lib. ix. Indict. vi. ep. 8.; Lib. xi. Indict.
vi. ep. 8. I will give a short specimen from the first and last
<i>Letters</i>:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Excellentiæ vestræ prædicandam ac Deo placitam bonitatem et
   gubernacula regni testantur et educatio fidel
   manifestat."&mdash;<i>Col.</i> 766.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Inter alia bona hoc apud vos præ ceteris tenet principatum, quod
   in mediis hujus mundi fluctibus, qui regentis animos turbulenta
   solent vexatione confundere, ita cor ad Divini cultus amorem et
   venerabilium locorum disponendam quietam reducitis ac si vos
   nulla alia cura sollicitet."&mdash;<i>Col. 1061.</i></p>

<p>Much to her merit, in the eyes of Gregory, arose from her abjuration of
Arianism, and the patronage she extended to religious houses. At the
same time, it is impossible to acquit her of the serious charges under
which she labours.</p>

<h3><span>LORD MAYOR NOT A PRIVY COUNCILLOR.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 9.)</span></h3>

<p>I entirely dissent from your correspondent's statements that "the Lord
Mayor is no more a privy councillor than he is Archbishop of
Canterbury." First, as to the argument on which your correspondent's
conclusion is founded. He assumes first that the title of Lord is a mere
courtesy title; and, secondly, that it is because of this courtesy title
that the Mayor is deemed a privy councillor. The second assumption is
the erroneous one. It is not necessary to have the courtesy title of
Lord in order to be a privy councillor; nor are all courtesy lords
styled Right Honorables. Your correspondent's assertion in this respect
is a curious blunder, which every day's experience contradicts. No one
styles a courtesy Lord "Right Honorable" except such persons as will
persist in the equally absurd blunder of calling a Marquis "Most Noble."
The Boards of the Treasury and Admiralty are not designated "Right
Honorable" merely because of the courtesy title of "Lord" being attached
to their corporate name, but because these Boards are respectively the
equivalents of the Lord High Treasurer and Lord High Admiral, each of
whom was always a member of the sovereign's Council. No individual
member of the Board is, by membership, "Right Hon." Your correspondent's
precedent is equally inconclusive on the subject. He says, "Mr. Harley,
when (1768) Lord Mayor of London, was sworn of His Majesty's most
honorable Privy Council." This precedent does not prove the argument;
and for this simple reason, that the individual who holds the office is
not "Right Honorable," but the officer is. Mr. Harley was not, as an
individual, a privy councillor, till he was made one: he could only have
appeared in council as "the Lord Mayor," and not as "Mr. Harley." The
description, therefore, of "The Right Honorable A. B., Lord Mayor,"
which has probably misled your correspondent, is, like the "Most Noble
the Marquis," a blunder of ignorant flattery; the correct description
being "A. B., the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor:" or rather, the A. B.
ought to be suppressed, except the individual, for a particular reason,
is to be personally designated, and the style should be written, "The
Right Honorable the Lord Mayor." This distinction between the officer
and the man is almost universal in our system. Our Judges are Lords in
court (yet, by-the-bye, this courtesy "Lord" does not give any one of
them at any time the title of Right Honorable, another instance of the
fallacy of your correspondent's reasoning), and they are Sirs in
individual designation. In Scotland the Judges assume the titles of
Baronies during their tenure of office, but become mere Esquires on
surrender of it. The Lord Mayor is always summoned to the council on the
accession of a new sovereign, and was formerly, when his office was of
greater practical importance than at present, accustomed to put his name
very high on the list of signatures attached to the declaration of
accession. A commoner might by the bare delivery of the great seal
become "Lord" in the Court of Chancery, and be the President of the
House of Lords, where he would sit by virtue of his office, without
having any title to speak or vote. Mr. Henry Brougham did so for one if
not two nights before his patent of peerage was completed. The same
distinction between officer and individual applies to the Lord Mayor,
who is Right Honorable as Lord Mayor, but in no other way whatever.</p>

<h3><span>COWPER OR COOPER.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 24.93)</span></h3>

<p>The poet's family was originally of Stroode in Slinfold, Sussex, not
Kent, as Lord Campbell (<i>Lives of the Chan.</i>, vol. iv. p. 258.) states,
and spelt their names Cooper. The first person who altered the spelling
was John Cooper of London, father of the first baronet, and he probably
adopted the spelling in affectation of the Norman spelling; the family
having in those days been styled Le Cupere, Cuper, and Coupre in
Norman-French, and Cuparius in Latin, as may be seen by the grants made
to Battle Abbey. The pronunciation was never changed. All the Sussex
branches continued the spelling of Cooper until the time of Henry Cowper
of Stroode, who died 1706. In
<a id="in138"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[138]</span>
Lord Campbell's <i>Lives of the
Chancellors</i> (p. 259.) the first letter is signed "William Cooper."</p>


<p class="right"> W. D. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OOPER</span>.</p>


<p>Cowper.&mdash;There is an affectation in the present day for pronouncing
words, not only contrary to established usage, but in defiance of
orthography. The Bar furnishes one example, and "polite society" the
other. By the former, a judge on the bench is called, instead of "My
<i>Lord</i>" and "His <i>Lordship</i>," "My <i>Lud</i>" and "His <i>Ludship</i>;" and in the
latter, <i>Cowper</i> is metamorphosed into <i>Cooper</i>. Now, I fancy that "My
<i>Lord</i>" is a vast deal more euphonious than "My <i>Lud</i>" and <i>Cowper</i>, as
Shakspeare has it, "becomes the mouth as well" as <i>Cooper</i>. We don't
speak of getting milk from the <i>coo</i>, but from the <i>cow</i>; and <i>Cow</i>
being the first syllable of the poet's name should not be tortured into
<i>Coo</i>, in compliment to a nonsensical fastidiousness, whoever may have
set the example. As <i>Cowper</i> the poet has been hitherto known, and by
that name will be cherished by posterity. John Kemble, the great actor,
I remember, tried to alter the pronunciation of <i>Rome</i> to <i>room</i>, and
was laughed at for his pains, though he had the authority of a pun of
the bard's own for the change: "Old <i>Rome</i> and <i>room</i> enough." But
Shakspeare was but an indifferent punster at the best, as is proved by
Falstaff's refusing to give a <i>reason</i> on compulsion, even though
"<i>reasons</i> were as plentiful as blackberries;" corrupting <i>raisin</i> into
<i>reason</i>, for his purpose, which is as far-fetched as any instance of
the kind on record, I think. But I digress, and beg pardon for running
so away from the <i>cow</i>.</p>

<p class="right">   J<span class="smcap lowercase">OHN</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">ULL</span>.</p>

<p>Lord Campbell, in his entertaining Lives of the <i>Chief Justices</i>, says,
in paragraph introductory to the life of Sir Edward Coke:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "As the name does not correspond very aptly with the notion of
   their having come over with the Conqueror, it has been derived
   from the British word 'Cock' or 'Coke' a 'Chief;' but, like
   'Butler,' 'Taylor,' and other names now ennobled, it much more
   probably took its origin from the occupation of the founder of
   the race at the period when surnames were first adapted in
   England. Even in Queen Elizabeth's reign, as well as that of
   James I., Sir Edward's name was frequently spelt 'Cook.' Lady
   Hatton, his second wife, who would not assume it, adopted this
   spelling in writing to him, and according to this spelling, it
   has invariably been pronounced."</p>

<p>Lord Campbell, who seems rather fond of such speculations, however, in
the case of Lord Cowper does not give the etymology of the name. But he
gives a letter written from school by the subsequent chancellor, in
which he signs his name "William Cooper." However, elsewhere, in a note
he speaks of the propensity evinced by those who have risen to wealth
and station to obliterate the trace of their origin by dropping, adding,
or altering letters and among them he mentions "Cowper" as having its
origin in "Cooper." Mr. Mark Antony Lower, too, in his <i>Essay on English
Surnames</i>, classes Cowper among the surnames derived from trade.
Possibly, therefore, notwithstanding the alteration, the original
pronunciation has been continued.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Replies to Minor Queries</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>Voce Populi Halfpenny</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., pp. 19. 56.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have <i>four</i>
varieties of this coin:</p>

<p>1. The one which J. N. C. describes, and which is engraved by Lindsay,
in his work on the coinage of Ireland, and is considered the rarest
type.</p>

<p>2. A precisely similar type, with the exception that the "P" is
<i>beneath</i>, instead of being <i>on the side</i> of the portrait.</p>

<p>3. A more youthful portrait, and of smaller size than the preceding, and
a trifle better executed. It wants the "P" altogether, and has for "MM."
a small quatrefoil. The engrailing also very different.</p>

<p>4. A totally different, and older portrait than any of the preceding.
"MM." and engrailing the same as No. 3., and it also wants the "P."</p>

<p>The reverses of all four appear to differ only in very minute
particulars. Pinkerton, in his <i>Essay on Medals</i>, vol. ii. p. 127.,
after stating that the Irish halfpence and farthings were all coined in
the Tower, and then sent to Ireland, there being no mint in that
country, remarks&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "In 1760, however, there was a great scarcity of copper coin in
   Ireland; upon which a society of Irish gentlemen applied for
   leave, upon proper conditions, to coin halfpence; which being
   granted, those appeared with a very bad portrait of George II.,
   and 'V<span class="smcap lowercase">OCE</span> P<span class="smcap lowercase">OPULI</span>' around it. The bust bears a much greater
   resemblance to the Pretender; but whether this was a piece of
   waggery in the engraver, or only arose from his ignorance in
   drawing, must be left in doubt. Some say that these pieces were
   issued without any leave being asked or obtained."</p>

 <p class="right">E. S. T<span class="smcap lowercase">AYLOR</span>.</p>

<p>I would have referred J. N. C. to either Pinkerton or Lindsay, where he
would find a full account about his Irish halfpenny, but as he may not
possess a numismatic library, perhaps you will allow me to trouble you
with the extracts. Pinkerton says:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"In 1760 there was a great scarcity of copper coin in Ireland

<p>&mdash;As no one
has hitherto appropriated these fine lines, as to the author of which
your correspondent inquires, I may mention that they are taken from the
"Chorus Sacerdotum," at the end of Lord Brook's <i>Mustapha</i>. (See his
Works, fol. 1633, p. 159.) The chorus is worth quoting entire:</p>


     <div class="poem">

      <p><i>Borne under one Law, to another bound</i>:</p>
      <p><i>Vainely begot, and yet forbidden vanity;</i></p>
      <p><i>Created sick, commanded to be sound:</i></p>
      <p>What meaneth Nature by these diverse Lawes?</p>
      <p>Passion and reason self division cause.</p>
      <p>Is it the mark or majesty of power</p>

      <p>Nature herself doth her own self defloure</p>
      <p>To hate those Errors she herself doth give.</p>

<p>&mdash;The work referred to by your correspondents is so
manifestly not the Composition of John Bunyan that it is extraordinary
that the title-page, which was evidently adopted to get off the book,
should ever have imposed upon anybody. The question, however, put by
your correspondents F. R. A. and N. H., as to who G. L. was, has not yet
been answered. The person referred to by these initials is the real
author of the book, who was George Larkin, a printer and author, and
great ally and friend of the redoubted John Dunton, who gives a long
character of him, in his <i>Life and Errors</i>, in his enumeration of London
printers. (See <i>Life and Errors</i>, edit. 1705, p. 326.)</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Mr. Larkin, Senior&mdash;He has been my acquaintance for Twenty
   years, and the first printer I had in London. He formerly writ a

<h4><span><i>Pope's Translations or Imitations of Horace</i></span> <span>(Vol. i., p. 230.; Vol.

<p>&mdash;I am much obliged to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> for having
corrected the error (for which I cannot account) in the <i>title</i> of the
pamphlet in question, which was certainly not by "<i>the author of the
Critical History of England</i>," and certainly was by Dennis, as is marked
by Pope's own hand in the copy now before me. As M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> puts
hypothetically the correctness of my quotation, I subjoin the whole
passages.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "After having been for fifteen years as it were an imitator, he
   has made no proficiency. His first imitations, though bad, are
   rather better than the succeeding, and this last Imitation of

<p>And again:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Of all these libellers the present Imitator is the most impudent
   and incorrigible."&mdash;P. 15.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> says he has a fragment of the "Imitation of the second
satire of the first book of Horace," published by Curll in 1716. This,
which I never saw, nor before heard of, would solve the difficulty; and
I respectfully request M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> to favour us with a transcript of
the title-page, which is the more desirable, because all Pope's
biographers, and indeed <i>he himself</i> (to Spence), have attributed his
first imitation of Horace to a <i>much</i> later date, certainly subsequent
to 1723. The imitation, therefore, of that satire
<a id="satire140"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[140]</span>
 of Horace,
printed in 1716 by Curll, is valuable as to Pope's history, and great
curiosity and as M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. CR<span class="smcap lowercase">OSSLEY</span> states that <i>Lady Mary</i> is not mentioned
in that edition, I am curious to know how Pope managed the <i>rhyme</i> now
made by <i>her name</i>.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> adds that this imitation was reproduced in "folio, printed
by J. Boreman about 1734, with some alterations from the former
edition." Would it be trespassing too much on your space and his
kindness, to request him to give us a few specimens of the alterations,
particularly the "change of <i>initials</i>" which M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> mentions.
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> seems to think that this poem was not reprinted after the folio
in 1734, till it appeared in a supplement to Cooper's edition in 1756.
This is a mistake. It was published by Pope himself, with his other
imitations of Horace, in the collection of his works by Dodsley in 1738;
and though only entitled "<i>in the manner of Mr. Pope</i>,", excited very
natural surprise and disgust. His having deliberately embodied it in the
general collection of his works, is Warton's only excuse for having
reproduced it.</p>

<h4><span><i>Prophecies of Nostradamus</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 86.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In accordance with the
wish of your correspondent S<span class="smcap lowercase">PERIEND</span>, I have examined the series of early
editors of this celebrated astrologer in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and
the following is the result of my inquiries.</p>

<p>The <i>earliest</i> edition of the <i>Prophecies of Nostradamus</i> is not to be
found in any library in Paris, but was published in 1555 (so says the
latest account of the prophet, by M. Eugène Bareste) but contains little
more than three centuries (or cantos, as they might be called) of
prophecies; each century containing a hundred quatrains. The next
edition, which before the French Revolution belonged to the Benedictines
of St. Maur, is entitled:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Les Prophéties de M. Michel Nostradamus, dont il y en a trois
   cens qui n'ont encore jamais esté imprimées. Adjoustées de
   nouveau par ledict Autheur. A Lyon, chez Pierre Rigaud, rue
   Mercière, au coing de rue Ferrandière. Avec permission."</p>

<p>It has, in MS., on the title-page, "1555 et 1558." M. Bareste says of
this edition:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "On prétend qu'elle est de 1558; mais nous ne le pensons pas, car
   elle a été probablement faite l'année même de la mort de
   l'auteur, c'est à dire, en 1566."</p>

<p>However, as there is no known edition between 1555, the date of the
first, and 1566, this doubtless is the earliest containing the ninth
century; and at No. 49. of this century is to be seen the following
quatrain:</p>

<p class="blockquot">      "Gand et Bruceles marcheront contre Anvers,
      Sénat de Londres mettront à mort leur Roy;
      Le sel et vin luy seront à l'envers,
      Pour eux avoir le regne en desarroy."</p>

<p>I can find no edition of Nostradamus dated 1572; but in the editions of
1605, 1629, 1649, and 1650, the prophecy is given as above, almost
letter for letter, so that there can be no doubt it was not first known
in that form in 1672. As to the number of this quatrain agreeing with
the year of King Charles's death, it is most probably an accident; for
out of the nine hundred and odd quatrains composing the twelve centuries
(the 7th, 11th, and 12th being imperfect), and which are nearly all
regularly numbered, it is, I believe, the only one in which this
singularity occurs. On the fly-leaf of a copy of Nostradamus in the
<i>Bibliothèque de S<span class="topnum">te</span> Geneviève</i> (dated 1568, but really printed in
1649), I found, in an old handwriting, a couplet that may be new to the
English admirer of the astrologer:</p>

   <div class="poem">
  <p> "Falsa damus cum Nostra damus, nam fallere nostrum est</p>
            <p class="i5">Et cum nostra damus, non nisi Falsa damus."</p></div>

<p>If S<span class="smcap lowercase">PERIEND</span> wishes for more information on the subject of the life and
works of Nostradamus, I should recommend him to look at the work I have
quoted above, which treats very fully on all matters connected with this
"vaticinating worthy." It is entitled <i>Nostradamus, par Eugène Bareste</i>:
Paris, 1840, and will doubtless be found in the British Museum.</p>

<p class="right">H. C. D<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>.
 C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROIX</span>.</p>

<p>I have an edition of 1605 of these prophecies, <i>Revueës et corrigées sur
la coppie imprimée à Lyon, par Benoist Rigaud</i>, 1586, but without place
or printer's name. It contains (century nine, stanza 49.), the quatrain
quoted by S<span class="smcap lowercase">PERIEND</span>.</p>

<p>The following quatrain may be thought to apply to Cromwell (century
eight, stanza 76.):</p>


<div class="poem">
    <p> "Plus Macelin que Roy en Angleterre,</p>
      <p>Dieu obscur nay par force aura l'empire:</p>
      <p>Lasche sans foy sans loy Seignera terre,</p>
      <p>Son temps s'aproche si près que je souspire."</p>
</div>

<p>The edition of 1605 does not contain the line quoted by S<span class="smcap lowercase">PERIEND</span>, "Sénat
de Londres," &amp;c.; nor any address "A mes Imprimeurs de Hongrie;" but, in
addition to the ten centuries contained in the edition of 1568 (the
<i>original</i> edition), it contains the eleventh and twelfth centuries;
also 141 stanzas of additional "Presages, tirez de ceux faicts par M.
Nostradamus en années 1555 et suivantes jusques en 1567:" and 58
"Predictions Admirables pour les ans courans en ce Siecle, Recueillies
des Memoires du feu M. Nostradamus, par Vincent Seve, de Beaucaire en
Languedoc, dès le 19 Mars, 1605, au Chateau de Chantilly."</p>

<p>My edition is not mentioned by Brunet nor in any of the French
Catalogues that I have been able to consult.</p>

<h4><span><i>Thread the Needle</i> </span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 39.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The following is an extract
from a review in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> of Dec. 1849, of the Life
of
<a id="of141"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[141]</span>
 Shirley; it may be interesting as explaining some part of
the verse in the game of "Thread the Needle:"</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Lord Nugent, when at Hebron, was directed <i>to go out by the
   needle's eye</i>, that is, by the small gate of the city; and in
   many parts of England, the old game of thread the needle is
   played to the following words:</p>


    <div class="poem">
 <p>"'How many miles to Hebron?</p>
       <p class="i3"> Three score and ten.</p>
      <p>Shall I be there by midnight?</p>
       <p class="i3"> Yes, and back again.</p>
         <p class="i5"> Then thread the needle,' &amp;c.</p>
</div>

   <p class="blockquot">"Now this explains and modifies one of the strongest and most
   startling passages of Scripture, on the subject of <i>riches</i>; for
   the camel can go through the needle's eye but with difficulty,
   and hardly with a full load, nor without stooping."</p>


<p>The above was copied out from the magazine on account of its explaining
the camel and the needle's eye: it does not tell much upon the Query
concerning the game of "Thread the Needle;" but it may be interesting,
and so is sent with pleasure by</p>

<p class="right">  E. F.</p>


<p>P.S. A friend suggests, could the game have come from the Crusades?</p>

<p>A line of players, the longer the better, hold hands and one end of the
line, which thus becomes almost a circle, runs and drags the rest of the
line after it through the arch made by the uplifted arms of the first
couple of the other end of the line&mdash;a process nearly enough resembling
<i>threading a needle</i>. There are subsequent evolutions by which each
couple becomes in succession the <i>eye of the needle</i>.</p>

<h4><span><i>Salmon Fishery in the Thames</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 87.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Those of your
readers who know that I am connected with Billingsgate market would look
to me for the reply to R. J. R.'s Query. I must therefore inform them
that only thirty or forty years back salmon were taken in rather large
quantities in the Thames; but since the introduction of steam-boats and
the increase of traffic, the fish have gradually, I might say suddenly,
disappeared, for during the last twenty years very few salmon indeed
have been taken: those that found their way to market have realised high
prices; not that Thames salmon was ever esteemed for its flavour, but
only for its extreme rarity of late years.</p>

<p>The hindrance to salmon taking the Thames is the steam-boat and other
traffic, which, agitating the water, frightens them (they being a very
timid fish), and stirs up the mud, which chokes them; for there is no
doubt that ever after a salmon enters a river, it lives by suction. It
is possible that one or two salmon a season even make up our river now,
for becoming frightened, and rushing on having back and head nearly out
of water, and the tide with them, they would get a long way in a night,
and possible reach clear water above bridge with life, but in a very
weak state. I believe that, under the most favourable circumstances,
salmon would not again frequent the Thames in any large quantities, it
being too southern; and there is no doubt but that the fish have been
fast decreasing of late years, for some of the best rivers in the north
are now without salmon.</p>

<h4><span><i>Entomological Query</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 101.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The insect which J. E. found
on the <i>Linaria minor</i> is probably either the <i>Euphitecia Linariata</i> or
<i>E. Pulchellata</i>. The former species is known to feed on Toad flax, and
there is little doubt that the latter does also. If J. E. found any of
the caterpillars he may identify them by referring to Westwood's
<i>British Moths</i>, vol ii. p. 59., where the caterpillar of <i>Euphitecia
Linariata</i> is engraved and described as "yellow or greenish, with dark
chesnut spots on the back and sides."</p>

<h4><span><i>School of the Heart</i> </span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 390.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The editor of the
<i>Christian Poet</i> referred to in a paragraph signed S. T. D. has not the
<i>School of the Heart</i> by Quarles at hand, and cannot now examine whether
the two small pieces quoted in the former volume under the name of
<i>Thomas Harvey</i> from S<span class="smcap lowercase">CHOLA</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORDIS</span> <i>in forty-seven emblems</i>, 1647,
belong to one or the other writer. The only authority, from which he
recollects to have gathered them, he believes to be Sir Egerton Brydges'
<i>Censura Literaria</i>, or his <i>Restituta</i>, which are very voluminous and
miscellaneous, and are at present beyond his research. From internal
evidence, he thinks the two poems are not by Quarles, though not
unworthy of him in his best vein.</p>

<p>P.S. Since the foregoing note was written, I have found the copy of Sir

<p>The third edition, dated 1675, ascribes these
<a id="these142"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[142]</span>
 emblems to the
author of <i>The Synagogue</i>, annexed to Herbert's <i>Poems</i>. This, according
to Sir John Hawkins, in his notes on Walton's <i>Angler</i>, was <i>Christopher
Harvie</i>: but Wood, in his <i>Athenæ</i>, positively affirms that the author
of <i>The Synagogue</i>, in imitation of the divine Herbert, was <i>Thomas
Harvey</i>, M.A., and first Master of Kingston School in Herefordshire. To
<i>him</i>, therefore (adds Sir Egerton Brydges), we may presume to assign
it, until a stronger testimony shall dispossess him of a tenure, which
reflects honourable reputation on the copiousness of his fancy and the
piety of his mind.</p>



<h4><span><i>Fortune, Infortune, Fort une</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 57.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I agree with M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
B<span class="smcap lowercase">REEN</span> that this inscription on the tomb of Margaret of Austria, in the
beautiful church of Brou, is "somewhat enigmatical," a literal
translation failing entirely to make sense of it. But perhaps MR. BREEN
may be willing to accept the interpretation offered by a writer in the
<i>Magasin Pittoresque</i> for 1850, where, describing the monuments in the
church of Notre Dame de Brou (p. 22.), he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Cette légende bizarre est assez difficile à expliquer, si l'on
   ne regarde pas le mot <i>infortune</i> comme un verbe. Avec cette
   hypothèse, la devise signifierait: 'La fortune a rendu une
   personne très-malheureuse?' Cette explication est d'autant plus
   plausible que la vie de Marguérite d'Autriche fut affligée de
   bien de revers. Destinée à regner sur la France, elle est
   répudiée par Charles VIII., son fiancé; elle épouse le fils du
   roi d'Aragon, qui la laisse bientôt veuve avec un fils qu'elle a
   aussi la douleur de perdre peu après; enfin, remariée à Philibert
   le Beau, elle le voit mourir au printemps de son âge."
</p>

<p>There is little doubt, I think that the inscription was meant to typify
the misfortunes of Margaret; but the preceding solution is still, in a
grammatical point of view, unsatisfactory. If <i>fort</i> could be transposed
to <i>fait</i>, the reading would be simple enough; but in these cases we are
bound to take the inscriptions as we find them, and the Rebus in stone
was the especial delight of the sculptors of the fifteenth century.</p>

<h4><span><i>Ackey Trade</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 40.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Ackey weights were, and I believe
are, used on the Guinea Coast for weighing gold dust: 1 ackey=20-<span  class="topnum">1</span>/<span  class="botnum">32</span>

<h4><span><i>Curious Omen at Marriage</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 406.)</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;H. A. B. asks at the
end of his Note, "Why a <i>coruscation of joy</i>, upon a wedding day, should
forebode evil?" and "Whether any other instances are on record of its so
doing?"</p>

<p>As these questions have remained unanswered for some weeks, I am tempted
to suggest that your correspondent may have laid too much stress on the
fact of the joy having been expressed at a <i>wedding</i>, and that the
passage he quoted from Miss Benger's <i>Memoirs of Elizabeth, Queen of
Bohemia</i>, may be simply an allusion to the old belief (still more or
less prevalent) of "<i>high spirits being a presage of impending calamity
or of death</i>." (See Vol. ii., pp. 84. 150.)</p>

<p>The late Miss Landon, in one of her novels, furnishes an additional
notice of this belief:</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "The ex-queen of Sweden has had one of the gentlemen of her suite
   put to death in a manner equally sudden and barbarous; and what
   excites in me a strong personal feeling on the subject is, that
   Monaldeschi, the cavalier in question, dines with me the very day
   of his murder, as I must call it. Such a gay dinner as we had!
   for Monaldeschi&mdash;lively, unscrupulous, and sarcastic&mdash;was a most
   amusing companion. His spirits, far higher than his usual
   bearing, carried us all along with them: and I remember saying to
   him, 'I envy your gaiety: why, Monaldeschi, you are as joyous as
   if there were nothing but sunshine in the world.' He changed
   countenance, and becoming suddenly grave, exclaimed, 'Do not call
   me back to myself. I feel an unaccountable vivacity, which I know
   is the herald of disaster.' But again he became cheerful, and we
   rallied him on the belief, which he still gaily maintained, that
   great spirits were the sure forerunners of
   misfortune."&mdash;<i>Francesca Carrara</i>, vol. ii. chap. 6.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your readers may be able to say whether Miss Landon had
the authority of any cotemporary writer for the anecdote. Is not the
warning, "<i>Sing</i> before noon, and you'll <i>sigh</i> before night," also a
proof of the dread with which "<i>coruscations of joy</i>" were looked upon
by our forefathers?</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p>The very unsatisfactory condition of the present laws on the subject of
international copyright has induced the eloquent author the <i>The History
of the Girondists</i>, when giving to the world <i>The History of the
Restoration of Monarchy in France</i>, to consent to write in English some
of the most important passages of that history with the view of
assisting his publishers in their endeavour to protect themselves
against piracy. To this circumstance we are indebted for the appearance
at the same moment of the English and French editions; and both at a
much lower price than that at which we have hitherto been accustomed to
receive original works. M. de Lamartine's present contribution to the
modern history of France cannot fail to excite great interest&mdash;despite
of the manifest prejudices of the writer; for it is written with marked
earnestness&mdash;not to say bitterness, and depicts in striking colours at
once the military genius and the heartless selfishness of Napoleon. The
history of the murder of Duc D'Enghien is told with consummate dramatic
effect; and as the reader finishes the narrative he feels, the force of
the author's closing words, "The murderer has but his hour&mdash;the victim
has all
<a id="all143"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[143]</span>
 eternity." The book will be read and re-read for its
brilliancy and interest; it can however never by quoted as an authority,
for its writer has disdained to quote those on which his own statements
are based. M. de Lamartine in making this omission has done injustice
both to himself and to his readers.</p>

<p><i>Letters Historical and Botanical, relating chiefly to places in the
Vale of Teign, &amp;c.</i>, by Dr. Fraser Halle, is a small volume which we can
conscientiously recommend as a desirable travelling companion to such of
our friends as may be about to visit this beautiful district of</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Lovely Devonia, land of flowers and songs."</p>

<p>It is clearly the production of a thoughtful scholar; and besides its
botanical notices and historical illustrations, contains many pleasant
snatches of old song, and hints of by-gone legends.</p>

<p><i>Lives of the most eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects,
translated from the Italian of Giorgio Vasari, &amp;c.</i>, by Mrs. Foster,
vol. iii., is another volume of Mr. Bohn's Standard Library. Vasari's
work was one of the favourite books of the unfortunate Haydon; and now,
when so much attention is being devoted by all classes to the fine arts,
when our nobles are throwing open their galleries to the public, and
admitting all to a free study of the exquisite works in their
possession, an English version of such a series of biographies as Vasari
has given us, and enriched as it is by notes and illustrations drawn
from his best commentators, cannot but find an extensive and ready sale.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson (3. Wellington Street) will sell on
Wednesday next a valuable collection of Engravings, the property of a
distinguished collector, by whom it was formed thirty years since,
chiefly from the Durand Collection; and on Thursday next a most
interesting collection of Manuscripts and Books of the poet Gray, the
whole in beautiful condition, together with a collection of various
editions of his works, a posthumous bust, and other items connected with
the poet. On Friday the same auctioneers will be engaged in the sale of
the interesting collection of Engraved British Portraits formed by the
late Thomas Harrison, Esq.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
